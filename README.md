## Context
This game was developed for the "Informatics Project 2" module by students of the University of Applied Sciences Duesseldorf.
## Narrative
You play a teacher of the object-oriented programming class. During your break, a bunch of students are following you to ask about solutions for their programming excercise. To get rid of those students you have to give them rubber ducks by collecting those. Some students are standing around, you may better not run into them.
